## Installation (macOS)

### Step 1: Download and Extract

1. Download the `KymFlow-macos-intel-*.zip` file from the releases page
2. Uncompress the zip file (double-click or use `unzip` in Terminal)
3. You should now have a `KymFlow.app` file

### Step 2: Run the Application (First Time)

macOS may show a warning about an "unknown developer" when you first try to open the app. This is normal for applications that aren't signed with an Apple Developer certificate. To run KymFlow:

1. **Option + Right-click** (or Control + Click) on `KymFlow.app`
2. Select **"Open"** from the context menu
3. You will see a warning dialog saying "KymFlow is from an unidentified developer"
4. Click **"Open"** in the warning dialog
5. The application will launch

!!! note "First Time Only"
    You only need to do this once. After the first time, you can double-click `KymFlow.app` normally and it will open without any warnings.

When you double-click the downloaded app, if you see this

Try these two things:

1. option + double-click the app

or

2. option + right-click the app and select 'Open...'
